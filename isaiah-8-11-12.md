## Translation Analysis

### The hand that grips — an extraordinary image

Before the command comes in v12, v11 sets the scene with one of the most physically intense images of divine communication in scripture. God doesn't whisper, doesn't send a dream. The Hebrew **כְּחֶזְקַת הַיָּד** (k'chezqat hayad — "with strength of the hand") describes being physically seized. This is the LORD grabbing Isaiah by the arm and saying *listen to me*.

Translations handle this differently. The KJV's **"with a strong hand"** is spare and literal. The NRSVue shifts to **"while his hand was strong upon me"** — making the hand God's, not just a strong force. The Geneva Bible reads **"in taking of mine hand"** — the most tender rendering, almost like a parent taking a child's hand. The NASB goes with **"mighty power"** — abstracting away the physical image entirely. Same Hebrew, five different relationships between God and prophet.

### קֶשֶׁר (qesher) — the word that splits the centuries

The word **qesher** is the hinge of v12, and it's where translations fracture most dramatically.

In Hebrew, qesher means a binding together — a conspiracy, a league, a pact. The historical context: the northern kingdom of Israel and Syria had formed an alliance against Judah (the Syro-Ephraimite crisis, ~735 BC). The people of Jerusalem were terrified. Everyone was whispering about "the conspiracy." God tells Isaiah: stop calling it that. Stop thinking like they think.

The KJV and Geneva chose **"confederacy"** — a political alliance, not necessarily sinister. This was the natural Elizabethan English word for a pact between nations. The Douay-Rheims and Vulgate use **"conspiracy"** (Latin: **coniuratio** — literally "swearing together"), which carries a darker, more subversive tone. Modern translations (ESV, NIV, RSV, NRSVue) all followed the Douay-Rheims and went with **"conspiracy."**

Then there's Wycliffe: **"swearing together."** This is the most literal rendering of the Latin *coniuratio* — he broke the word apart and translated its roots rather than using an English equivalent. It's clunky but transparent.

The translation choice matters theologically. "Confederacy" suggests a political worry — stop obsessing over alliances. "Conspiracy" suggests paranoia — stop seeing threats everywhere. The Hebrew qesher supports both readings, but modern translations have decisively moved toward the paranoia interpretation, which makes the verse feel more universal: *don't adopt the fears of the crowd.*

### מוֹרָאוֹ (mora'o) — whose fear?

The phrase **וְאֶת־מוֹרָאוֹ לֹא־תִירְאוּ** (v'et mora'o lo tir'u) uses the noun **mora** (fear, dread, the thing feared) with a third-person suffix — "its fear" or "his fear." But what does that mean?

Two readings:
1. **"Do not fear what they fear"** (ESV, NIV, NASB) — the object of the people's terror. Don't be afraid of the same things the crowd is afraid of.
2. **"Do not fear their fear"** (KJV, Geneva, Douay-Rheims) — the fear itself. Don't let their panic infect you. Fear is contagious, and God says don't catch it.

The KJV/Geneva rendering is more psychological — it's not just about the external threat, it's about the emotional contagion of a frightened population. The modern translations flatten this into a simpler instruction about the threat itself. Both are defensible from the Hebrew, but the older rendering captures something the newer one misses: that fear itself is the danger, not just the thing being feared.

### תַעֲרִיצוּ (ta'aritzu) — the escalation

The verse ends with a second fear word: **ta'aritzu** (from ערץ, *arats* — to tremble, to be terrified, to dread). This is stronger than the ordinary fear word (ירא, *yare'*) used earlier in the verse. The doubling — don't fear, don't dread — is an escalation, not a repetition. God isn't saying the same thing twice. He's saying: don't be afraid, and don't even get close to afraid.

The KJV's **"nor be afraid"** flattens both fear words into near-synonyms. The ESV's **"nor be in dread"** preserves the escalation better. Wycliffe's **"neither be ye afeared"** uses an archaic intensifier that works surprisingly well — "afeared" carries more weight than plain "afraid."
