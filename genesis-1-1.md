## Translation Analysis

### The NRSVue stands alone: "when God created" vs "God created"

The most striking difference here is the NRSVue's rendering: **"In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth,"** — note the trailing comma. This treats the verse as a temporal clause ("When God began creating...") rather than an independent statement ("God created"). The NRSVue follows a minority scholarly reading that connects verse 1 to verse 2 as a single complex sentence, reading *bereshit* as a construct form ("in the beginning of God's creating").

Nearly every other English translation reads it as a definitive, standalone declaration: **"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."** Period. Full stop. A completed thought asserting creation *ex nihilo* (from nothing).

This is not a trivial difference. The traditional reading asserts absolute beginning — God created everything from nothing. The NRSVue reading implies God shaped pre-existing material ("the earth was formless and void" in verse 2 becomes the starting condition, not the result).

### "heaven" (singular) vs "the heavens" (plural)

The Hebrew **הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם** (hashamayim) is grammatically dual/plural. Older translations (KJV, Geneva, Douay-Rheims) rendered it as singular **"heaven"**, reflecting the theological concept of one created realm above. Modern translations use **"the heavens"**, which more accurately reflects the Hebrew grammar and the ancient Near Eastern cosmology of multiple heavenly layers (atmosphere, sky, celestial realm).

### Wycliffe's "made of nouyt" — creation from nothing

Wycliffe's 1395 translation adds an interpretive phrase not in the Hebrew: **"made of nouyt"** (made of nothing). This is theological commentary embedded in the translation — Wycliffe was explicitly asserting *creatio ex nihilo*, the doctrine that God created from nothing rather than from pre-existing matter. No other major translation adds this, but Wycliffe felt the doctrinal point was important enough to state directly.

### אֵת (et) — the untranslatable word

The Hebrew particle **אֵת** (et) appears twice in this verse, before "the heavens" and "the earth." It's a direct object marker with no English equivalent — it signals that what follows is receiving the action of the verb. Every translation simply drops it, but in Jewish mystical tradition (Kabbalah), the inclusion of *et* (spelled aleph-tav, the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet) has been interpreted as signifying that God created everything from A to Z — the entirety of existence.

### Elohim — the plural name for God

**אֱלֹהִ֑ים** (Elohim) is grammatically plural, but paired with a singular verb **בָּרָ֣א** (bara — "he created"). Every translation renders this simply as "God" (singular). The plural form has generated centuries of theological discussion: is it a "plural of majesty" (royal we), an echo of polytheistic origins, or an early hint of the Trinity? Translators universally sidestep this by using the singular "God," letting the reader encounter the tension only in the original.
