## Translation Analysis

This verse is remarkably consistent across nearly every major English translation — a rarity. The core phrasing "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" has remained essentially unchanged for over 400 years. The theological weight of the verse demanded extreme care from translators, and the Greek is relatively unambiguous.

However, the interesting differences lie in the details:

### "with" vs "at" vs "toward"

The Greek preposition **πρὸς** (pros) with the accusative case literally means "toward" or "facing" — it implies active relationship and orientation, not merely static proximity. Most translations flatten this to **"with"**, which is adequate but loses the dynamic sense of the Word being *oriented toward* God, face-to-face in intimate communion.

Wycliffe's **"at God"** is an older English rendering of the same idea. The Latin Vulgate's **"apud"** (meaning "in the presence of" or "at the home of") preserves more of the relational nuance than the English "with."

### "the Word" — why not translate λόγος?

**Λόγος** (logos) is famously untranslatable. In Greek philosophy (particularly Stoicism and Heraclitus), logos meant the rational principle governing the universe — reason, logic, the ordering force of reality. In Jewish thought, it echoed the creative *dabar* (דָּבָר) of God — the spoken word through which God created in Genesis 1 ("And God said...").

Every major translation leaves it as "Word" (capitalized) rather than attempting alternatives like "Reason," "Logic," "Expression," or "Message." This is a deliberate choice: translators recognized that no single English word captures both the philosophical and theological weight of logos, so they chose the closest equivalent and let the reader bring the context.

### The third clause: "the Word was God" vs "God was the Word"

The Greek word order is **θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος** — literally "God was the Word." English translations reverse this to "the Word was God" for natural English word order. Both are grammatically valid translations, but the Greek construction is significant: by placing **θεὸς** (theos/God) first without the definite article (no "the" before God), the Greek emphasizes the *nature* or *quality* of the Word — the Word had the nature of God — rather than saying the Word was identical to God the Father. This is a crucial distinction in Trinitarian theology: the Word is fully divine, but the Word and the Father are not the same person.

This subtlety is invisible in every English translation, which is why the original language matters.
