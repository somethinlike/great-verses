# Great Verses

A personal study project comparing Bible translations across time.

Each file contains a single verse with:
1. The original Hebrew or Greek text
2. Multiple English translations, starting with NRSVue and moving backward in time
3. A space for personal interpretation
4. Analysis of why translators made different word choices

Translations are selected for **significant word choice differences** — not every translation of every verse, just the ones where the choices reveal something interesting about the text.

## Fair Use Notice

Modern translations (NRSVue, ESV, NASB, etc.) are quoted in single-verse excerpts with scholarly commentary, which constitutes fair use. Public domain translations (KJV, ASV, YLT, Douay-Rheims, WEB) have no such restrictions.
