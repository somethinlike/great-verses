## Translation Analysis

### Three words, three fault lines

This verse looks simple — two clauses, a clean contrast — but translators split three ways on nearly every key term. The Hebrew is a single sentence with no ambiguity about structure, yet English versions disagree on what humans are doing, what God is doing, and what "standing" means.

### מַחֲשָׁבוֹת (machashavot) — "plans" undersells it, "devices" oversells it

The Hebrew **machashavot** (from חשב, *chashav* — to think, reckon, devise) covers a wide semantic range: thoughts, plans, schemes, inventions, calculations. It's morally neutral — the same root describes God's thoughts in Jeremiah 29:11 ("I know the plans I have for you") and human scheming in Genesis 6:5 ("every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil").

The KJV and Geneva chose **"devices"** — Elizabethan English for schemes or contrivances, carrying a slightly suspicious undertone. Modern translations landed on **"plans"**, which is cleaner but loses the sense of mental churning. The Douay-Rheims and Wycliffe followed the Vulgate's **"cogitationes"** (cogitations/thoughts) — the most interior, psychological reading. Where modern English sees planning (action-oriented), the Vulgate tradition sees thinking (mind-oriented).

None is wrong. The Hebrew word straddles all three.

### לֵב (lev) — heart or mind?

Hebrew **lev** doesn't map to the English heart/mind split. In Hebrew anthropology, the heart is the seat of thought, will, AND emotion — there's no Cartesian separation. Most translations say **"heart"** (KJV, NIV, NASB, Douay-Rheims, Wycliffe). The NRSVue and ESV switch to **"mind"** — a deliberate modernization that's technically defensible but loses the Hebrew holism. When the text says *lev*, it means the whole inner person: your plans, your feelings about those plans, your will driving them. "Mind" narrows it to cognition.

### עֲצַת (atzat) — the biggest divergence

This is where translations genuinely disagree about what God does. The Hebrew **atzat** (from יעץ, *ya'ats* — to counsel, advise, purpose) means counsel or deliberate purpose. Three camps:

1. **"Purpose"** (ESV, NIV, RSV, NRSVue) — God has a fixed outcome in mind. Emphasizes sovereignty and predetermined will.
2. **"Counsel"** (KJV, Geneva) — God gives guidance, wisdom, direction. Carries a relational tone — counsel is something given to someone, not imposed on them.
3. **"Will"** (Douay-Rheims, Wycliffe, following Vulgate **"voluntas"**) — God's active volition. The strongest sovereignty reading — not just a plan, but a willed decree.

The Vulgate's choice of **voluntas** over **consilium** (the Latin word for counsel) is itself an interpretation. Jerome chose the word that emphasizes divine authority over divine wisdom. Every translation downstream from the Vulgate inherited that emphasis.

The NASB uniquely chose **"advice"** — the mildest reading, almost pastoral. God as advisor rather than sovereign planner.

### תָקוּם (taqum) — what does it mean to "stand"?

The Hebrew **taqum** (from קום, *qum* — to rise, stand, be established) is concrete and physical: it rises up, it stands firm, it endures. Translations fan out:

- **"Shall stand"** (KJV, ESV, NASB, Geneva) — most literal. It stands because nothing knocks it down.
- **"Will be established"** (RSV, NRSVue) — more formal, suggests institutional permanence.
- **"Prevails"** (NIV) — the most dynamic reading, implying active contest. God's purpose wins against human plans.
- **"Shall dwell"** (Wycliffe) — the most unusual. Suggests God's will takes up permanent residence, not just that it survives.
- **"Permanebit"** (Vulgate) — "shall remain/endure." Jerome chose duration over triumph.

The NIV's "prevails" adds a competitive element the Hebrew doesn't explicitly state — though the verse's structure (human plans vs. God's purpose) certainly implies it. The KJV's "shall stand" is closest to the raw Hebrew image: something rising and staying upright while everything else falls.
